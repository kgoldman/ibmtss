Most users will begin by untarring the tarball or cloning the git repo,
and then executing 'make' in the utils and utils12 directories.

$ cd utils
$ make
$ cd utils12
$ make

This builds a TSS
- with TPM 2.0 and TPM 1.2 support,
- connecting to a TPM 2.0 SW TPM,
- with TSS state files in cwd,
- with tracing support,
- and with elliptic curve support.


Advanced options
----------------

For all options and details, see the documentation in ibmtss.doc or
ibmtss.html.

Some of the more common options are below.

1-3 can also be specified in an environment variable or at run time.

4-8, which are used to reduce the size of the library, must be
specified at compile time.

1) To default to a hardware TPM (rather than the SW TPM)

Add to CCLFLAGS:

	-DTPM_INTERFACE_TYPE_DEFAULT="\"dev\""

2) To default to /dev/tpmrm0 (rather than /dev/tpm0)

Add to CCLFLAGS:

	-DTPM_DEVICE_DEFAULT="\"/dev/tpm0\""

3) To default to a different directory for TSS state files (rather
than cwd)

Add to CCLFLAGS:

	-DTPM_DATA_DIR_DEFAULT="\"directory\""

4) To remove TPM 1.2 support

Delete from CCLFLAGS and CCAFLAGS

	-DTPM_TPM12

5) To remove the requirement for a filesystem (see documentation for
limitations)

Add to CCFLAGS

	-DTPM_TSS_NOFILE

6) To remove the requirement for crypto (see documentation for
limitations)

Add to CCFLAGS

	-DTPM_TSS_NOCRYPTO

7) To remove print tracing support

Add to CCFLAGS

	-DTPM_TSS_NOPRINT

8) To remove elliptic curve dependencies

Add to CCFLAGS

	-DTPM_TSS_NOECC
